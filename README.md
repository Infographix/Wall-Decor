# **Methods and Protocols for Decorative Wall Design**  
*A Professional-Grade Technical Reference for Non-Structural Decorative Wall Treatments Using Accessible Materials and Standardized Protocols*

---

## 📘 **About This Project**

This comprehensive, single-page interactive document serves as a complete technical guide to **non-structural decorative wall treatments**, tailored for:

- Interior designers  
- DIY enthusiasts  
- Contractors  
- Architecture students  
- Property owners  

It synthesizes best practices from **architectural finishing**, **decorative arts**, and **materials science** into a visually engaging, accessible, and standardized format—ideal for both professional specification and hands-on implementation.

> **Note**: All techniques described are **non-structural** and intended for interior surfaces only. Always conduct surface testing and follow safety protocols before full-scale application.

### 🎨 **Six Core Decorative Techniques**  
Each technique includes **materials**, **tools**, **step-by-step protocols**, **variations**, and **visual examples**:

1. **Geometric Tape Segmentation**  
   - Crisp, modern patterns using painter’s tape  
2. **Roller-Applied Texture Systems**  
   - From stipple to geometric repeats  
3. **Subtractive Glazing**  
   - Rag rolling, sponging, dragging, and combing  
4. **Three-Dimensional Relief Applications**  
   - Stenciling with joint compound for tactile depth  
5. **Framed Panel Systems**  
   - Architectural molding with decorative infills (e.g., wainscoting, picture rails)  
6. **Hand-Stamping**  
   - Custom stamps for repeatable artisanal motifs

## 💰 **Cost Reference (Indian Market, 2025)**

| Wall Area | Typical Project Cost (10m²) |
|----------|------------------------------|
| Basic techniques (e.g., tape segmentation) | ₹800 – ₹1,500 |
| Intermediate (e.g., glazing, stamping) | ₹1,500 – ₹3,000 |
| Advanced (e.g., relief work, framed panels) | ₹3,000 – ₹5,000 |

> Costs include materials only; labor not factored unless self-applied.

## ⏱️ **Time Investment**

- **Active work time**: 6–20 hours (varies by technique complexity)  
- **Total elapsed time**: 1–5 days (includes drying/curing between coats)

---

## 🛡️ **Safety & Environmental Guidelines**

All featured techniques prioritize:

- **Water-based, low-VOC materials**  
- **Non-structural surface interventions**  
- **Appropriate PPE** (gloves, masks, eye protection)  
- **Proper ventilation** during application and drying  
- **Safe disposal protocols** for leftover materials and tools  

---

## 🔧 **Maintenance & Longevity**  
*Under normal indoor conditions:*

| Technique Type | Unsealed Lifespan | Sealed Lifespan |
|----------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Painted finishes | 5–10 years | 10–15 years |
| 3D relief work | 3–7 years | 10–15 years |
| Framed panel systems | 10–20 years | 20–30 years |

> Sealing with clear acrylic or polyurethane significantly extends durability.
